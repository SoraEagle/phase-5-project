# Phase 5 Project
This is the repository for my Phase 4 Project.

## Description
This project uses *React*, *React-Redux*, *React-Router-Dom*.

This project creates an website where individuals can make a User account, and make reservations (aka Bookings) at different Hotels.

## Requirements
- Postgresql
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Ruby 2.7.4
- Render account (*optional*)

## Visuals
[My Demonstration]()

## Installation
Fork and clone this repository, and then run
```
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```
to install the gems.

## Usage
Using two seperate terminals:

- Start up the Postgresql database with 
```
sudo service postgresql start
```

You can use the following commands to run the application: 
- `rails s`: run the backend on [port 3001](http://localhost:3001)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on [port 4000](http://localhost:4000)
## Roadmap
I may update this code to include *admin privileges*, if I have the time for it in the future.

Otherwise, I currently have no plans to update this application.
